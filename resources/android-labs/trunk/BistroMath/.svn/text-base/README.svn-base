BistroMath

A specialized calculator for solving certain "bistromatic" calculations involving numbers
on a a waiters check-pad and people in restaurants. For a certain net amount, 
we can optionally calculate tax, tip, how to split the bill among N people and for
international travelers, what all this would mean in another currency. Use menu to set
the necessary input parameters and see the numbers dance as a result.

Use menu or touch-screen to select which parameter to input an any affected fields will update
automatically. Rows which currently are not applicable are hidden in the display unless they
are active for input. For data input, use the virtual key-pad or the equivalent keys on the 
keyboard if available.

Input parameters are:
Price: total amount of restaurant bill (pre or post tax depending on the situation)
Tax: tax rate applied to price
Tip: tipping rate applied to price
Split: number of people among which to divide the bill equally
FX Rate: currency conversion rate between the local currency of the restaurant and the users own
  currency in case of international travel.
  
See display fields for "Total" or "Per Person" for how much should be payed based on the above input.
